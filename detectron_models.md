# Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) technique 
this technique means that the features are extracted at different layers of the model's architecture(instead of taking the output feature from the last layer and feed to the prediction process)
Using FPN backbone helps to increase the accuracy with the time trade-off.

# Developing computer vision applications using Detectron2 includes the following steps:
1. Selecting a configuration file 
2. Getting a predictor 
3. Performing inferences 
4. Visualizing Results
