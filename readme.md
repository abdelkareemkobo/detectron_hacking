# Exploring Detectron2 
[My vision garden](https://github.com/abdelkareemkobo/exploring_computer_vision)
- Welcome to my personal repository for exploring Detectron2! Here, I will be studying the algorithms in Detectron2, reading related papers, and summarizing my findings. My approach is to learn by applying, so I will be taking notes and assigning challenges to upgrade my current level.
# Technologies 

The main technologies I will be using are PyTorch and PyLabel. 

# Features 

Some of the features of this repository include:

- Personal notes and challenges to upgrade skills
- Essential Detectron2 capabilities and power learning
- Notebooks from Colab and Kaggle, among other sources

# Setup 

To use this repository, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher and PyTorch 1.3 or higher installed.
# Todo
